# This example illustrates how to create a negative campaign criterion for a
# given campaign. To create a campaign, run add_campaign.rb.

  # ENV['HOME']/adwords.properties when called without parameters.

  campaign_criterion_srv = adwords.get_service('CampaignCriterion', latest)

  # Prepare for adding criterion.
  # The 'module' method being called here provides a shortcut to the
  # module containing the classes for this service. This helps us avoid
  # typing the full class name every time we need to create an object,
  # e.g. AdWords::V200909::CampaignCriterionService::NegativeCampaignCriterion
  campaign_criterion =
