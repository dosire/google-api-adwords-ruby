0.6
- added support for API v5
- added support for alternateUrl header, in order to work with sandbox
- tested with sandbox
0.5 Now supports AdWords API v4. Got rid of yaml dependency. Changed properties file name for default credentials to adwords.properties. Enhanced the readme.txt a bit. Added a few samples.
0.4 Now all generated classes are within the Adwords module. Will make it easier to use that in Rails. Support for gen classes in a module is not implemented in soap4r for doc/literal style (it works for rpc/encoded). I logged a bug for soap4r. In the meantime I had to fix adwords4r from my module using module_eval to patch the Mapping class.
0.3 fixed the bug in InfoService and many others. I fix the wsdl before generation.
0.2 added packaging, made it a gem, and added a setup program, for easy installation in all configurations (gem and non gem).
0.1 -first version, not fully tested
works for Campaigns
