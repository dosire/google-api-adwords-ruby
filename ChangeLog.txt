12.1.0
- Removed support for v11 of the API, which has been deco'ed.
- Replaced some old examples that weren't behaving properly with better, well-commented example code.

12.0.0
- Added support for v12 of the AdWords API.
  Removed support for v10 of the API, which has been deco'ed.

11.1.0
- Added additional attributes to the AdWords::Error::ApiError class.
  This should make it easier to get all the useful SOAP fault information, some of which wasn't available in the previous version.
  The extra attributes are :trigger_ex, :soap_faultcode_ex, :soap_faultstring_ex, and :code_ex
- Added static methods to the AdWords::API class to retrieve API unit usage information.
  AdWords::API.get_total_units() will return the a running total of API units used since the API was initialized.
  AdWords::API.get_last_units() will return the number of API units used for the last API call.
- Started the process of creating new sample code. The existing code samples are a bit lacking and were moved to the 'examples/old' directory.
  A new sample program, 'examples/reports.rb' was created. This sample validates, schedules, and downloads a Keyword Structure report.
  It's a fairly extensive sample and illustrates some of the new API features as well as general best-practices. 
  Look for more sample code in future releases.

11.0.3
- update soap4r minimum version requirement in the .gem file to 1.5.8, as there are compatibility problems with 1.5.6
- the ADWORDS4R_DEBUG environment variable was causing problems when it was not set instead of silently disabling debugging; this is fixed.

11.0.2
- Jeffrey Posnick (jeffy@google.com) takes over as maintainer of this project
- added support for AdWords API v11
- removed support for AdWords API v9
- added support for the ADWORDS4R_DEBUG environment variable--if set to TRUE, SOAP logs will be written to the current directory when the API is used
- added support for the SiteSuggestionService for API v10 and v11

1.0
- added support for API v10
- removed support for APIs v6, v7 and v8
- used soap4r v1.5.6 to generate the API files from the WSDL
- added soap4r v1.5.6 and http-access2 v2.0.5 as gem dependencies
- cleaned up some of the kludges that were needed for older soap4r libraries
0.8
- Ryan Leavengood takes over as maintainer of this project
- added support for APIs v7, v8 and v9
- removed support for v4 and v5
- updated the examples amd made it so they will use the adwords4r in their parent directory
0.7
- added support for API v6
- uncommented clientEmail in sample property file
0.6
- added support for API v5
- added support for alternateUrl header, in order to work with sandbox
- tested with sandbox
0.5 Now supports AdWords API v4. Got rid of yaml dependency. Changed properties file name for default credentials to adwords.properties. Enhanced the readme.txt a bit. Added a few samples.
0.4 Now all generated classes are within the Adwords module. Will make it easier to use that in Rails. Support for gen classes in a module is not implemented in soap4r for doc/literal style (it works for rpc/encoded). I logged a bug for soap4r. In the meantime I had to fix adwords4r from my module using module_eval to patch the Mapping class.
0.3 fixed the bug in InfoService and many others. I fix the wsdl before generation.
0.2 added packaging, made it a gem, and added a setup program, for easy installation in all configurations (gem and non gem).
0.1 -first version, not fully tested
works for Campaigns
